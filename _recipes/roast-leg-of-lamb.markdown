- "½ pound kefalograviera cheese (sharp Greek cheese)"
- 2 teaspoons of fresh thyme or 1 teaspoon of dried thyme
- 2 Tbsp of fresh chopped rosemary or 1 Tbsp of dried rosemary

- Salt and pepper
- "½ cup water"
- Parchment paper
- Aluminum foil

Bake the whole garlic for 20 minutes (375°F) on a parchment paper. Let it cool and peel. You can keep it in the refrigerator in a glass container for a month. 

Preheat oven to 425°F

Cut kefalograviera cheese in little cubes.

Put the leg of lamb on a piece of parchment paper big enough to wrap it in a package. Make little holes with a sharp knife. Insert in each hole either a piece of the kefalograviera cheese or a clove of roasted garlic.

In a bowl mix together the thyme, oregano, rosemary, salt and pepper and rub generously all around the roast leg. Rub the Dimitri Lemon Infused extra virgin olive oil all around the roast leg and wrap it tightly in the parchment paper. Put in a roasting pan, add the water in the pan and cover the pan with an aluminum foil.

Roast at 425°F for 20 minutes. Then reduce the heat to 350°F and roast an additional hour. Check the meat thermometer. Remove from the oven anywhere from 130°F to 135°F for medium rare. Lamb should never be cooked until well done or it will be too dry. Let stand for 15-20 minutes before carving. Collect the juice from the parchment paper in the roasting pan. While the roast is resting, use a metal spatula to scrape up the drippings in the roasting pan. Use the drippings to make gravy, or use just the drippings to serve with the lamb.

Cut away the kitchen string and slice with a sharp carving knife, 1/2 inch thick slices.
